# k-means-clustering
## Description
This project implements a K-Means clustering model to group customers based on their annual income and spending score. The dataset is preprocessed, and the Elbow Method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters. The model is then trained with the identified number of clusters, and the results are visualized to show the customer segmentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used is 'Mall_Customers.csv', which contains customer information, including their annual income and spending score.
